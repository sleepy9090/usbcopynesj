usbcopynesj
===========

A Java port / w.i.p. of the USB CopyNES software. Currently is uses JD2XX to attempt to load FTDI's ftd2xx DLL.

Currently works with FTDI drivers on windows.
Ubuntu is having issues with loading the the driver.

Initial putback:
- Basic GUI
- Connects with USB CopyNES
- No real functionality yet.
